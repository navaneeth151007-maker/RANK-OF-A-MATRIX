# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:

Step 1: Start with the matrix
Step 2: For each column c from 0 to n–1
Step 3: Count number of non-zero rows

## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.

#RegisterNumber:25009883
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]])
x=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(x)
```
## Output:
